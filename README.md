# Michigan Engineering ‚Äì Applied Generative AI Specialization

This repository highlights projects I‚Äôve completed as part of the **Applied Generative AI Specialization** offered by Michigan Engineering (powered by Simplilearn).  

Each project demonstrates practical applications of Python and Generative AI, with a focus on solving real-world problems and accelerating workflows using modern AI tools.

## üìÇ Projects

- **[Python Refresher: Customer Orders](./AnalyzeCustOrdersPython.ipynb)**  
  Refreshed Python fundamentals by building data structures for storing and categorizing customer orders.  
  This project was developed in **Google Colab**, where I leveraged **Google Gemini** as a coding copilot to optimize solutions and guide my process.  
  In the past, I would spend significant time digging through library documentation; now, AI-assisted development helps me iterate faster and achieve results with quicker turnaround.  

- *More projects coming soon:* LLM fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Responsible AI practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Skills
- Python (lists, dictionaries, loops, data organization)
- Google Colab & Jupyter Notebooks
- Generative AI copilots (Gemini, ChatGPT)
- Applied Generative AI methods
